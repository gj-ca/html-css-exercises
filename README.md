# HTML & CSS Extra Challenges

## How to start
You'll notice that there are no files or challenges at the moment. Each one of these challenges are separated by a branch in git and will be released periodically, you are currently in the master branch and can switch to the first challenge by running the command `git checkout first-branch` in your terminal inside this git repository.

Once you have switched branches, you'll be able to see a README.md file with the next instructions.
