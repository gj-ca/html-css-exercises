# HTML & CSS Extra Challenges

## What now?
Great job switching branches and pulling down from github, I knew you had it in you. We've written a couple of straight-forward challenges to practice your html by mimicking something existing. Now is also a good time to practice some more git, after you've finished each challenge remember to git add and commit after you've saved your work. 

## What next?
After you have completed both challenges and added/committed your work, you can switch to the next branch called 02-css-fundamentals. Remember that you only want to switch branches when it is safe to do so, you can test if it is safe by running the command `git status` and if the last of your output says 'working tree clean' then you are safe to switch branches by running the command `git checkout -b 02-css-fundamentals`. Once you've switched branches you'll need to pull down from github to download all the files into the new branch.
